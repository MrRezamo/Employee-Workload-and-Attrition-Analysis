## 🔍 Notebook 1 — EDA (`EDA.ipynb`)

- Data overview: shape, dtypes, missing values
- Target variable distribution (Attrition: Yes vs No)
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Department & role-level breakdowns
- Key business insights & observations

---

## 🤖 Notebook 2 — ML Modeling (`modeling.ipynb`)

- Feature engineering & encoding
- Train/test split with stratification
- Baseline: Logistic Regression
- Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix & feature importance plots
- Model export with `joblib` → saved to `models/`

---

## 📈 Notebook 3 — Dashboard (`dashboard.ipynb`)

- Interactive charts built with **Plotly**
- Attrition breakdown by department, role, and salary band
- Workload vs performance scatter plots
- Satisfaction vs attrition trend analysis
- Filters and dropdowns for dynamic exploration

---

## 💡 Key Business Questions

1. Which departments have the highest attrition rate?
2. Does overworking correlate with leaving the company?
3. What is the relationship between salary and job satisfaction?
4. Which features are the strongest predictors of attrition?
5. Can we reliably predict which employee is likely to leave?
